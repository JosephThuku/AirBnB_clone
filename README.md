# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

The AirBnB project approaches the first real web developer project, the console is the 
first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone. 

This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project 
with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, 
front-end integration.
